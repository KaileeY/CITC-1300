            <h1>Fun Activities Insipirded by The Magic School Bus</h1>
            <p>Learning is more fun when you get involved! Inspired by the exciting field trips from The Magic School Bus, these hands-on activities are perfect for kids, parents, and teachers who want to bring science to life. Whether you're exploring the human body, diving into the ocean, or launching into space, these activities will help you dive deeper into the magic of science .Science is all around us! Here are a few easy and fun experiments inspired by some of the show's most memorable episodes.</p>

                    <h2>Grow Your Own Germs: Inspired by “Inside the Human Body”</h2>
            <p>In this experiment, learn how bacteria and germs grow by creating your own petri dish. All you need is gelatin, water, sugar, and a swab to collect samples from everyday objects. After a few days, you'll see bacteria colonies grow—just like in the body!</p>
            <p>Materials Needed:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Gelatin</li>
                    <li>Warm water</li>
                    <li>Sugar</li>
                    <li>Cotton swabs</li>
                    <li>Small dishes</li>
                 </ul>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Mix gelatin, water, and sugar to create the "agar" base.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into a small dish and let it cool.</li>
                    <li>Use a cotton swab to collect samples from various surfaces (like a doorknob or phone).</li>
                    <li>Lightly rub the swab onto the surface of the gelatin in the dish</li>
                    <li>Cover the dish and observe the bacterial growth over a few days!</li>
                 </ul>

                <h3>Solar System Model: Inspired by “Lost in Space”</h3>
            <p>Build your own solar system model using everyday craft materials. This activity allows you to explore the planets and their order in space.</p>
            <p>Materials Needed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Styrofoam balls (various sizes for planets)</li>
                <li>Paint and paintbrushes</li>
                <li>String and a hanger (to hang the planets)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Paint each Styrofoam ball to represent a planet in the solar system.</li>
                    <li>Once dry, tie a piece of string to each planet and attach them to a hanger in the correct order from the Sun.</li>
                    <li>Hang your model up and admire your mini solar system!</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>DIY Volcano: Inspired by "Blows Its Top"</h3>
            <p>Create your own volcanic eruption using simple household ingredients. Just like in the episode about volcanoes, you can simulate a volcanic eruption using baking soda and vinegar!</p>
            <p>Materials Needed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Baking soda</li>

                <li>Dish soap</li>
                <li>Red food coloring</li>
                <li>A plastic Bottle for the volcano</li>
                <li>Paper and tape to form the volcano shape</li>           
             </ul>
             <p>Instructions:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Place the plastic bottle in the center of a tray.</li>
                <li>Build a paper "mountain" around it, leaving the top of the bottle exposed.</li>
                <li>Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda, a drop of dish soap, and red food coloring to the bottle.</li>
                <li>Pour in vinegar and watch the eruption!</li>
             </ul>
