        <h1> The Magic School Bus-What Is It?</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108847/">The magic school bus</a>  was a show that followed an elementary school teacher and her students on the wacky yet educational adventures they took in their magical school bus. The bus itself really lives up to its title by being able to transform into different vehicles and change its size. The bus was also able to turn the kids into other animals multiple times, so there is no doubt it was in fact magic. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcVa8KhqThg">theme song</a> even says that none of the field trips that the kids take with their teacher, Ms. Frizzle, are ever normal. Through every episode you see that this statement is not an exaggeration every trip they take is unlike any trip anyone has ever taken. This is actually a large selling point with the show, because the trips are so outlandish the information that is stored within the episodes is easier to remember.

        <h2>Memorable Stories</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One time the class went to space and one of the kids took their helmet off and died, yet they were back to normal the very next scene of the episode. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639559/?ref_=tt_eps_top" >The class once</a> traveled inside one of the students body's in order to find out why he was sick </li>
            <li>They once became bees in order to learn more about bees and get honey for on of the students</li>
            <li>The school bus was turned into a ship and the children became pirates for the day looking for the treasure that Ms. Frizzle's ancestor had a map for</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is This Legal?</h3>
        <p>A large concern that has been brought up in recent years is, would Ms. Frizzle legally be allowed to take the children on such dangerous field trips? The short answer is probably not, but it is a children's television show, so you don't have to look too far into it. Although, when you do go into it the irresponsible actions of Ms. Frizzle would have led to the children's untimely demise multiple times. During just the space episode alone she put all the children in very comparable positions several times, at one point she even left them alone to fly the bus throughout space without any adult supervision. The amount of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/negligence">negligence</a>  that she displays during these field trips would case her and her school district to be paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawsuits and possibly send Ms. Frizzle to prison. As fun as Ms. Frizzle's adventures seemed to be when we were younger looking back does spoil some of that excitement when you realize if you actually went on one of the trips you probably would not make it out alive.</p>
